TO-DOs Microservices Backend
This repository contains the backend implementation for a TO-DOs web application using microservices architecture. The system consists of two microservices:

Todos Microservice: Manages todos with CRUD operations. Runs on port 3000.

Notification Microservice: Handles sending notifications for approaching todo deadlines. Runs on port 4000.

Assumptions
Authentication: No authentication is required, and there is only a single user.

Single User: The application serves a single user. For multi-user support, modifications are needed.

sendNotification(): Assumes this method is implemented for sending notifications but does not provide specifics.

Data Validity: For the purpose of this assignment, we assume the received data is correct and follows the expected structure and format. However, in a real-world scenario, it is crucial to implement proper input validation and error handling to ensure data correctness, integrity, and security.

How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Install dependencies for both microservices.
Configure MongoDB connection strings in the microservices' respective config files.
Start both microservices:
Todos Microservice: cd todos-microservice && npm start (Port: 3000)
Notification Microservice: cd notification-microservice && npm start (Port: 4000)
Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update the connection strings accordingly.

Note: Additional enhancements and considerations may be required based on specific requirements and use cases. Input validation and error handling should be implemented in a production-ready application to ensure data correctness, prevent security vulnerabilities, and handle errors or exceptions that may occur during data processing.
